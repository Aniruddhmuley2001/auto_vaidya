- Google Analytics
- Website Optimization
- Soft UI
- Documenatation of the project using mkdocs/sphinx

Note:

- For facilitating folks of all skill level, the front is meant to be built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript
- React development can be done in a parallel branch
- Flask is preferred because of easy hosting and quick integration of models trained in TensorFlow/PyTorch
- TensorFlow.JS development can also be donw in a parallel branch for client side sercing
